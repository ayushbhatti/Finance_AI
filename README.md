# Algorithmic Trading Model for Apple Stock

## Overview

This project contains a Python script that implements a basic algorithmic trading strategy using machine learning. The strategy is based on the simple moving average (SMA) crossover method to generate buy and sell signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. The script utilizes historical stock price data fetched from Yahoo Finance, calculates moving averages, and uses logistic regression to predict trading signals based on these averages.

## Features

**Data Fetching:** Retrieves historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance.

**Signal Generation:** Generates trading signals based on the crossover of 30-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA).

**Machine Learning Model:** Uses logistic regression to predict buy and sell signals from SMA data.

**Backtesting:** Calculates the strategy's returns and plots the cumulative returns over time to evaluate performance.

##  Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following packages installed:

Python 3.6 or higher

pandas

yfinance

scikit-learn

## How It Works

**Data Fetching**: The script starts by fetching historical price data for Apple (AAPL) from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2023, using the yfinance library.

**SMA Calculation**: It then calculates the 30-day and 100-day simple moving averages for the closing prices.

**Signal Processing:** A trading signal is generated where:

1. Signal = 1: The 30-day SMA crosses above the 100-day SMA (buy signal).

2. Signal = -1: The 30-day SMA crosses below the 100-day SMA (sell signal).

**Model Training:** The script trains a logistic regression model on the data up to the end of 2021 to predict future signals.

**Model Prediction & Evaluation:** The model makes predictions for the year 2022, and these predictions are evaluated to see how well the model performed.

**Backtesting:** Finally, the script calculates and plots the cumulative returns based on the model's predictions to assess the profitability of the strategy.

## Plotting

The script uses matplotlib to plot the cumulative returns of the trading strategy, providing a visual representation of the strategy's performance over the test period.
